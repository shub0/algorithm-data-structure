'''
Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.
push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
